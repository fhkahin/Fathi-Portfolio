# Portfolio: Refugee Case Worker to Software Developer

## About Me

I am a biomedical scientist by training, currently working as a refugee case worker for a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers in rebuilding their lives and integrating into society. My role involves assisting clients in finding suitable educational resources, providing housing support, and offering guidance on accessing benefits and financial aid.

While fulfilling my duties as a case worker, I discovered a passion for technology and coding. I believe in the transformative power of coding and its ability to create positive change. Determined to combine my desire to help others with my newfound interest in programming, I joined Code Your Future, an organization that aligns with my values and goals.

I am excited to embark on this journey, leveraging my transferable skills and experience as a case worker to excel in the tech sector. With a commitment to continuous learning and a drive to make a meaningful impact, I am eager to grow as a software developer.
